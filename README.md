Inspired by the wonderful book [Modern Computer Algebra](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139856065)

I have always been facinated by polynomials and their properties. I have decided to collect all my knowledge about polynomials and algebra here, just for fun :)

This repository will be slowly filled with various algorithms I have learnt throughout my education and career.
